# PyChatGPT - OpenAI chat App 

A simple and easy to use GUI for the OpenAI API built using Python and Customtkinter.

## Libraires used
- tkinter
- Customtkinter
- Pickle
- OS
- OpenAI

## Instructions
The app will require the above libraries to be installed in order to run properly. I used a virtual environment, so you
should do that as well when trying to run the app, and you will also need to provide your own OpenAI API key.

## Screenshots
